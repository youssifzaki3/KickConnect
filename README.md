KickConnect is a **SwiftUI mobile app prototype** designed to connect football players by allowing users to **host and join local football matches anytime, anywhere**.  

#This prototype demonstrates the progress made in developing the **core structure and main screens** of the application.

## Project Overview

KickConnect aims to solve the problem of organising casual football matches by providing a platform where players can:

- Sign up and log in  
- Browse available matches  
- Filter matches by skill level, age group, pitch size, and duration  
- Host their own matches  
- View upcoming football-related events  
- View their account details and game statistics  
- Log out or delete their account  

> This is the first prototype for IPD, so it **does not include backend functionality yet**.

- Sign Up screen with validation  
- Login screen with prototype authentication using **UserDefaults**  
- Main Tab Navigation system  
- Join Match view with filtering and match cards
